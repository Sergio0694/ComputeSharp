    /// runtime handles caching of device instances, this method has the following behavior:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    ///     <item>If no device has been created, create the default one, cache it, and return it.</item>
    ///     <item>If a cached device is available, return that.</item>

    /// the returned <see cref="GraphicsDevice"/> instance is disposed incorrectly (eg. with some existing resources not being
    /// disposed, which would keep the underlying device object alive), calling <see cref="GetDefault"/> again will result in
    /// an exception instead of a different device being returned. That is, if enumerating adapters and trying to create a device
    /// fails due to device lost (as opposed to other valid failures when trying to normally create a device), an exception will be
    /// thrown instead of just skipping that adapter, because that would mean a device had been created but incorrectly disposed.
