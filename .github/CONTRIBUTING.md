## 🙋 Questions, bug reports, feature proposals

If you have a questions, want to report a bug, feel free to just open an issue selecting the right template. Make sure to fill in all requested sections and to include as many details as possible, as this will greatly speed up triage and make things easier for maintainers.

## 🚀 Opening a PR

PRs can be divided into two distinct categories:
- "Trivial PRs", such as PRs just fixing very small things (eg. typos, or one-line bugs), can just be opened directly.
- Larger PRs with bug fixes or new features **should first have a linked issue opened**, so that the change can be discussed beforehand.

In either case, make sure to follow the PR template and to describe the proposed changes in detail when opening a PR.
